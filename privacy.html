    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: January 15, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how "FotoRevive" (the "App") and its associated website (collectively, the "Service"), created by Yanmei Chen, manages your information. By using the Service, you agree to the terms set out in this policy regarding the collection and use of your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <h3>1.1 How We Collect and Process (Face Data in App)</h3>
    <p>Our App offers powerful AI-powered features, "Face Restoration" and "Animate." To enable these features, we process media files that you voluntarily provide. This section details the specific data involved, which may include face data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For the "Face Restoration" Feature (powered by GFPGAN):</strong> When you use this feature, we process the digital photograph you select to analyze pixel data and enhance facial features.</li>
        <li><strong>For the "Animate" Feature (powered by Live Portrait):</strong> When you use this feature, we process source photographs and driving videos to provide motion data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> We DO NOT collect or store biometric identifiers. We do not use this data to create a faceprint or geometric scan of your face, nor do we use it to personally identify any individual. The data is treated solely as an input for the requested one-time computational task.</p>

    <h3>1.2 How We Use and Share Your Information</h3>
    <p>The use of your media files and any face data contained within is strictly limited to providing the AI feature you have explicitly requested.</p>
    <p><strong>The Process:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>User-Initiated Action:</strong> You select your media files within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Transmission:</strong> Your device securely transmits files via encrypted HTTPS to our third-party API provider, Replicate.com. This is the only context in which media files are shared.</li>
        <li><strong>Ephemeral Cloud Processing:</strong> The AI model processes files temporarily in the server's RAM.</li>
        <li><strong>Return and Deletion:</strong> The result is sent back to your device. Replicate.com deletes original files immediately after processing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We solemnly swear that we will never use your media files for advertising, user profiling, or for training AI models.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Data Storage and Retention (Zero-Retention Policy)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Our Servers:</strong> We do not operate our own servers for media storage. We do not retain any of your files.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Servers (Replicate.com):</strong> Files exist only temporarily for the duration of the processing task and are not retained.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Device:</strong> The final result is stored exclusively on your local device only when you choose to save it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Website Data & Cookies</h2>
    <p>When you visit our website, we may collect certain information automatically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Like most websites, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Service. This Log Data may include your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and other statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Our website and App may use "cookies" to gather information and improve our services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies. Please be aware that if you choose to refuse them, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Log Data and Analytics (App)</h2>
    <p>If an error occurs while using the App, we collect data via Firebase Crashlytics ("Log Data"). This may include your IP address, device name, OS version, and timestamp. We also use Google Analytics for Firebase to understand usage patterns (e.g., button clicks, screen views) to improve the App. This data is for internal analysis only and is not sold.</p>

    <h2>4. Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We employ third-party companies to facilitate our Service, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Replicate:</strong> For AI image and video processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Google (Firebase):</strong> For app analytics, crash reporting, and hosting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your personal information. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 14. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 14. In the case we discover that a child under 14 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete this from our servers.</p>

    <h2>7. Compliance with Laws</h2>
    <p>We may disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of our Service.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:fotorevive.feedback@gmail.com">fotorevive.feedback@gmail.com</a>.</p>
